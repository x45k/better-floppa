### 1.8.9 Forge Template for Kotlin

This tempalte is meant to serve as a base configuration for gradle & loom. While creating my first mod in kotlin, I stuggled very much setting up a project. This repo is for everyone to use so they do not have to experience that.

### Usage

Clone the repo and run the run script `loom/genIntelliJRuns`. This will generate the run configurations for IntelliJ. When you are ready to test, run the `loom/runClient` run config to start a Minecraft instance. Once ready to publish / use, run `build/jar`. Have fun!
